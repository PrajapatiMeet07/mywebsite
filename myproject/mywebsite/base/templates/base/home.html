                    <p>If you have no work experience whatsoever, you should write a resume objective instead of a resume summary.

                        A resume objective is also a 2 or 4-sentence-long paragraph that goes at the top of your resume. However, instead of focusing on your professional experience and accomplishments, it highlights your career goals and aspirations, skills, and/or academic achievements.
                        
                        As such, a resume summary is better suited for candidates writing a resume with no experience in a specific field, such as students, recent graduates, or people changing careers.
